## Approach : 
This Project is all about Real Estate. As we divide this project into sections and those sections based on different branches as we collaborately worked on those things. This Project is based on html , css and JavaScript as needed. We merged different sections of Project into central branch named as Master. The Object was to create a static website and use git branching, Resolve conflicts and work as a team.

- We had worked on Front-end development of website and we had created sections into website according to the requirements like About, Services, Projects, Testimonials, Contact and Footer to make our website looks attractive.

## Algorithms :
